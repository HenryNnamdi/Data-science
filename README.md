Python is an open source language widely used language for data science, because of its flexibility and easy to use libraries. One of the most important aspects of learning python language is being able to learn to create functionalities, Python is made up of so many built-in functions, and I'm going to take you through one of them which is "Python Strings"


This tutorial will explain what Python strings means, and teach you the Python syntax for declaring strings as well as the common string methods used in data science.

## What is Python Strings?

A string is a character sequence. It is one of the most commonly used data types in Python. It is simple to make by enclosing characters in quotes. Strings are formed by enclosing characters in single or double quotes.


Example

```
myString = "My name is Henry"
Print(myString)
```

Output

```
My name is Henry
```
N.B: You can use either single or double quotes.

### STRING METHODS
String Methods are built-in methods you can use on strings in Python and we have a lot of string methods used in Python language but we will focus on the most commonly used Python string methods.


1. Append(): The append method adds a single element to an already existing list. Rather than being returned to a new list, the element will be added to the end of the old one.
 Example
 ```
 String = [Mr John Doe will be home]
 string Method = string.append(soon)
 
 ```
 Output
 ```
 [Mr John Doe will be home soon]
 ```

2. Split(): The split method in Python divides a string into a list of strings by breaking it with the specified separator.


EXAMPLE 
```
String = The Tower's Manager traveled last week.

String Method = string.split('T')
print(String)

```

Output 
```
[he, ower's, Manager, raveled, las, week.]
```


.
Append():
Strip():
Pop():
Swapcase():

Upper():The Upper method copies the string and returns it with the first character uppercase and the rest lowercase
Example 
```
String = [philip]
 
String Method = string.upper(string)

print(string)
```
Output

```
[Philip]
